        (www.cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/FaceData2.html)
        (www.bias.csr.unibo.it/fvc2000/download.asp) etc.
step 3: separately kept the training dataset and test dataset in two different folder and kept in MATLAB folder which is present
        in Document folder of mycomputer.
step 4: implement the surfFeatures.m code


Note:- Remember that the dataset folder and main code should be in same folder
       (C:\Users\user_name\Documents\MATLAB)
